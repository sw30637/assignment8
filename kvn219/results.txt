The graphs are center on a critical question, over time how does wealth/income change over
time with respect to different regions?  I decided that I wanted to look at the top three
countries within their region and compare how they were doing against other top three countries
across the world.  To my shock there is huge disparity among the wealthiest of the wealthy.
The old saying, a giant among midgets, comes to mind when I analyze the results.
Moreover, the something that also stands out is the range in which the graph shows.
Going from anywhere in the less than $10,000 ballpark to over $90,000 really crystalizes
the stark reality of income inequality among the countries of the world.
